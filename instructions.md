# Hack Cambridge Project: Mask Detection by [INSERT PROJECT TEAM NAME]

[INSERT DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT]

## Example description below
This project demonstrates the [Udacity self-driving-car dataset](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car) and [YOLO object detection](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo) into an interactive [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) app.

The complete demo is [implemented in less than 300 lines of Python](https://github.com/streamlit/demo-self-driving/blob/master/streamlit_app.py) and illustrates all the major building blocks of Streamlit.

### Project Workflow:
* Loading the Face Mask Classifier model
* Detect Faces in the image
* Extract each Face Region of Interest(ROI)
* Apply face mask classifier to each face ROI to determine 'mask' or 'No mask'
